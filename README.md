# Job Site
Creating a Django based job search website from scratch. My motivations are simple:
to create a an online community where employers are able to easily connect with job 
condidates without using a 3rd party hiring agency.

# Project Background
I am using the accounts Django app I created from my django-auth-bootstrap4 repo to 
implement the custom user model and email based authentication. I want to give the ability 
of a job seeker to market thier skills and expewrience in a direct and simple way. 

The goal of this site is to have a functionality more in line with Indeed instead of LinkedIn.

That means no activity 'feeds' with senseless and irrelevant information that does not add 
value to the job seeker's goal of finding employement.
